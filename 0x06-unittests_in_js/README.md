# 0x06. Unit Tests in JavaScript

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building and writing unit tests in JavaScript using popular testing libraries like **Mocha**, **Chai**, and **Sinon**. The goal is to ensure code correctness and reliability by implementing thorough tests for various functionalities, including synchronous and asynchronous operations, mock testing, and testing backend services using **ExpressJS**.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the purpose and structure of unit tests.
- Write and run tests using **Mocha** and **Chai**.
- Use **Sinon** for creating spies, stubs, and mocks.
- Test asynchronous code, including promises and callbacks.
- Conduct integration tests for backend services in **ExpressJS**.
- Employ **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** practices.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Node.js**
- **Mocha** - JavaScript test framework
- **Chai** - Assertion library
- **Sinon** - Spies, stubs, and mocks
- **ExpressJS** - Web framework for Node.js

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (v12.x or higher)
- **npm** (v6.x or higher)
- **Mocha**, **Chai**, and **Sinon** should be installed as development dependencies.

Install required dependencies using:
```bash
npm install
